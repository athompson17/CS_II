Created on October, 15 ,2022
version 0.1, a version that only worked for the word computer
        bugs: only works for one world
Version 1.0, adjusted code to work for all words
        bugs: no documentation
version 1.2, added documentation
        bugs: none
LeftCirc: takes the input 'start1' and counts that number down the variable 'data1' then moves that selected part to the
end of the word ex. computer, 3 = putercom
RightCirc: counts the integer amount of Start1 from the back of the word and moves it to the front
ex. computer, 3 = tercompu
Bonus: none

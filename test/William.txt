ACT  

SCENE  Athens room Palace Theseus

 Enter Theseus  Hippolyta  Philostrate Attendants 

THESEUS 
Now  fair Hippolyta  nuptial hour
Draws apace  four happy days bring in
Another moon  oh  methinks  how slow
This old moon wanes    lingers desires 
Like step dame dowager 
Long withering out young man revenue 

HIPPOLYTA 
Four days quickly steep themselves night 
Four nights quickly dream away time 
  moon  like silver bow
New bent heaven  behold night
Of solemnities 

THESEUS 
Go  Philostrate 
Stir up Athenian youth merriments 
Awake pert nimble spirit mirth 
Turn melancholy forth funerals 
    pale companion pomp 

  Exit Philostrate 

Hippolyta    woo   sword 
 won thy love doing   injuries 
But   wed   another key
With pomp  triumph  revelling 

 Enter Egeus  Hermia  Lysander Demetrius 

EGEUS 
Happy Theseus  renownèd Duke   

THESEUS 
Thanks  good Egeus  news    

EGEUS 
Full vexation   complaint
Against child  daughter Hermia 
St forth  Demetrius  My noble lord 
This man hath consent marry 
St forth  Lysander   gracious Duke 
This man hath bewitch bosom child 
Thou   Lysander  hast given rhymes 
 interchang love tokens child 
Thou hast moonlight  window sung 
With feigning voice  verses feigning love 
 stol n impression fantasy
With bracelets thy hair  rings  gauds  conceits 
Knacks  trifles  nosegays  sweetmeats (messengers
Of strong prevailment unharden youth)
With cunning hast filch daughter heart 
Turn obedience (which due me)
To stubborn harshness   gracious Duke 
Be before grace
Consent marry Demetrius 
I beg ancient privilege Athens 
As mine   may dispose 
Which either gentleman
Or death  according law
Immediately provided case 

THESEUS 
What say  Hermia   advis  fair maid 
To father should god 
One compos beauties  yea  one
To whom  form wax
By  imprinted  within power
To leave figure  disfigure 
Demetrius worthy gentleman 

HERMIA 
So Lysander 

THESEUS 
In himself 
But kind  wanting father voice 
    other   held worthier 

HERMIA 
I  father look eyes 

THESEUS 
Rather eyes   judgment look 

HERMIA 
I entreat Grace pardon 
I know power   made bold 
Nor how may concern modesty
In such presence plead thoughts 
But  beseech Grace  may know
    worst may befall case 
If  refuse wed Demetrius 

THESEUS 
Either die death  abjure
For ever society men 
Therefore  fair Hermia  question desires 
Know youth  examine well blood 
Whether  yield father choice 
You can endure livery nun 
For aye shady cloister mew 
To live barren sister life 
Chanting faint hymns cold fruitless moon 
Thrice blessèd  master  blood
To undergo such maiden pilgrimage 
But earthlier happy rose distill d
Than which  withering virgin thorn 
Grows  lives  dies  single blessedness 

HERMIA 
So  grow  live  die  lord 
Ere  yield virgin patent up
Unto lordship  whose unwishèd yoke
My soul consents give sovereignty 

THESEUS 
Take time pause  next new moon
    sealing day betwixt love me
For everlasting bond fellowship 
Upon day either prepare die
For disobedience father 
Or else wed Demetrius   
Or Diana altar protest
For aye austerity single life 

DEMETRIUS 
Relent  sweet Hermia   Lysander  yield
Thy crazèd title certain right 

LYSANDER 
You  father love  Demetrius 
Let  Hermia  marry  

EGEUS 
Scornful Lysander  true  hath love 
 mine love render  
 mine  right her
I estate unto Demetrius 

LYSANDER 
I  lord  well deriv 
As well possess  love more than 
My fortunes every way fairly rank 
If vantage  Demetrius  
  which more than these boasts can 
I belov beauteous Hermia 
Why should   prosecute right  
Demetrius   ll avouch head 
Made love Nedar daughter  Helena 
 won soul   sweet lady  dotes 
Devoutly dotes  dotes idolatry 
Upon spotted inconstant man 

THESEUS 
I   confess   heard much 
 Demetrius thought  spoke thereof 
But  being over full self affairs 
My mind did lose —But  Demetrius   
   Egeus  go 
I  some private schooling both —
For  fair Hermia  look arm yourself
To fit fancies father 
Or else law Athens yields up
(Which means may extenuate)
To death  vow single life 
Come  Hippolyta  cheer  love  
Demetrius Egeus  go along 
I   employ some business
Against nuptial  confer
Of something nearly concerns yourselves 

EGEUS 
With duty desire follow 

 Exeunt Lysander Hermia  

LYSANDER 
How  love   Why cheek pale  
How chance roses  fade fast  

HERMIA 
Belike want rain  which  could well
Beteem them tempest eyes 

LYSANDER 
Ay me    For aught  could ever read 
Could ever hear tale history 
    course true love never did run smooth 
But either was different blood—

HERMIA 
O cross    Too high enthrall low 

LYSANDER 
Or else misgraffèd respect years—

HERMIA 
O spite    Too old engag young 

LYSANDER 
Or else stood upon choice friends—

HERMIA 
O hell    choose love another eyes   

LYSANDER 
Or were sympathy choice 
War  death  sickness did lay siege 
Making momentany sound 
Swift shadow  short any dream 
Brief lightning collied night
That  spleen  unfolds both heaven earth 
  ere man hath power say  ‘Behold    
    jaws darkness devour up 
So quick bright things  confusion 

HERMIA 
If  true lovers  ever cross 
It stands an edict destiny 
Then  us teach trial patience 
Because customary cross 
As due love thoughts dreams sighs 
Wishes tears  poor fancy followers 

LYSANDER 
A good persuasion  therefore  hear  Hermia 
I  widow aunt  dowager
Of great revenue  hath child 
From Athens house remote seven leagues 
 respects only son 
There  gentle Hermia  may  marry   
 place sharp Athenian law
Cannot pursue us  lovest  
Steal forth thy father house tomorrow night 
 wood  league without town
(Where  did meet   once Helena
To observance morn May) 
There  stay   

HERMIA 
My good Lysander   
I swear   Cupid strongest bow 
By best arrow golden head 
By simplicity Venus  doves 
By which knitteth souls prospers loves 
 fire which burn Carthage queen
When false Trojan under sail was seen 
By vows ever men  broke
(In number more than ever women spoke) 
In same place hast appointed 
Tomorrow truly  meet   

LYSANDER 
Keep promise  love  Look  comes Helena 

 Enter Helena 

HERMIA 
God speed fair Helena    Whither away  

HELENA 
Call fair   That fair again unsay 
Demetrius loves fair  happy fair   
Your eyes  lode stars tongue sweet air
More tuneable than lark shepherd ear 
When wheat green  hawthorn buds appear 
Sickness catching  were favour 
Yours   catch  fair Hermia  ere  go 
My ear should catch voice  eye eye 
My tongue should catch tongue sweet melody 
Were world mine  Demetrius being bated 
    rest  give translated 
O  teach how look  art
You sway motion Demetrius  heart   

HERMIA 
I frown upon   yet loves still 

HELENA 
O frowns  teach smiles such skill   

HERMIA 
I give  curses  yet gives love 

HELENA 
O prayers could such affection move   

HERMIA 
    more  hate  more follows 

HELENA 
    more  love  more hateth 

HERMIA 
His folly  Helena  fault mine 

HELENA 
None beauty   fault were mine   

HERMIA 
Take comfort  more see face 
Lysander myself fly place 
Before time  did Lysander see 
Seem Athens paradise 
O    graces love dwell 
That hath turn heaven into hell   

LYSANDER 
Helen  minds unfold 
Tomorrow night  Phoebe doth behold
Her silver visage watery glass 
Decking liquid pearl bladed grass
(A time lovers  flights doth still conceal) 
Through Athens  gates  devis steal 

HERMIA 
 wood where often I
Upon faint primrose beds were wont lie 
Emptying bosoms  counsel sweet 
There Lysander myself meet 
 thence Athens turn away eyes 
To seek new friends stranger companies 
Farewell  sweet playfellow  Pray us 
 good luck grant   thy Demetrius   
Keep word  Lysander    starve sight
From lovers  food  till morrow deep midnight 

LYSANDER 
I  Hermia 

 Exit Hermia  

Helena  adieu 
As   Demetrius dote

 Exit Lysander  

HELENA 
How happy some er other some can be   
Through Athens  thought fair 
But    Demetrius thinks 
He know know 
 errs  doting Hermia eyes 
So  admiring qualities 
Things base vile  holding quantity 
Love can transpose form dignity 
Love looks eyes  mind 
 therefore wing Cupid painted blind 
Nor hath love mind any judgment taste 
Wings  eyes  figure unheedy haste 
 therefore love said child 
Because choice oft beguil 
As waggish boys game themselves forswear 
So boy Love perjur everywhere 
For  ere Demetrius look Hermia eyne 
He hail down oaths was only mine 
 hail some heat Hermia felt 
So dissolv  showers oaths did melt 
I go tell  fair Hermia flight 
Then wood tomorrow night
Pursue  intelligence
If   thanks  dear expense 
But herein mean  enrich pain 
To  sight thither back again 

 Exit Helena

    Over park  over pale 
        Thorough flood  thorough fire

    Swifter than moon sphere

    In  gold coats spots see

    In those freckles live  savours 
I   go seek some dew drops

Farewell  lob spirits   ll gone 
Our Queen elves  anon 

PUCK 
    King doth keep revels tonight 
Take heed Queen  within sight 
For Oberon passing fell wrath 
Because  attendant  hath
A lovely boy  stol n an Indian king 
She never had sweet changeling 
 jealous Oberon   child
Knight train  trace forests wild 
But perforce withholds lovèd boy 
Crowns  flowers  makes  joy 
  never meet grove green 
By fountain clear  spangled starlight sheen 
But  square   elves fear
Creep into acorn cups  hide them 

FAIRY
Either  mistake shape making quite 
Or else   shrewd knavish sprite

That frights maidens villagery 
Skim milk  sometimes labour quern 
 bootless make breathless housewife churn

Mislead night wanderers  laughing   harm  
Those Hobgoblin call  sweet Puck 
You  work    good luck

PUCK 
Thou speak st aright

I jest Oberon  make  smile 
When  fat bean fed horse beguile 
Neighing likeness filly foal

In very likeness roasted crab

Sometime three foot stool mistaketh 
Then slip  bum  down topples

OBERON 
Ill met moonlight  proud Titania 

TITANIA 
What  jealous Oberon    Fairies  skip hence 
I  forsworn bed company 

OBERON 
Tarry  rash wanton   thy lord  

TITANIA 
Then    thy lady   know
When hast stol n away fairyl 
 shape Corin sat day
Playing pipes corn  versing love
To amorous Phillida  Why art 
Come farthest steep India 
But  forsooth  bouncing Amazon 
Your buskin mistress warrior love 
To Theseus   wedded  come
To give  bed joy prosperity  

OBERON 
How canst thus  shame  Titania 
Glance  credit Hippolyta 
Knowing  know thy love Theseus  
Didst lead  through glimmering night
From Perigenia  whom ravished  
 make  fair Aegles break faith 
With Ariadne Antiopa  

TITANIA 
These   forgeries jealousy 
 never  since middle summer spring 
Met hill  dale  forest  mead 
By pavèd fountain  rushy brook 
Or beachèd margent sea 
To dance ringlets whistling wind 
But thy brawls hast disturb sport 
Therefore winds  piping us vain 
As revenge   suck up sea
Contagious fogs  which  falling l 
Hath every pelting river made proud
That   overborne  continents 
    ox hath therefore stretch yoke vain 
    ploughman lost sweat  green corn
Hath rotted ere youth attain beard 
    fold stands empty drownèd field 
 crows   fatted murrion flock 
    nine men morris fill up mud 
 quaint mazes wanton green 
For lack tread    undistinguishable 
    human mortals want  winter 
No night hymn carol blest 
Therefore moon  governess floods 
Pale anger  washes air 
That rheumatic diseases abound 
 thorough distemperature see
    seasons alter  hoary headed frosts
Fall fresh lap crimson rose 
 old Hiems  thin icy crown
An odorous chaplet sweet summer buds
Is  mockery  set spring  summer 
    childing autumn  angry winter  change
Their wonted liveries  mazed world 
By  increase  knows which which 
 same progeny evils comes
From debate  dissension 
We    parents original 

OBERON 
Do amend    lies 
Why should Titania cross Oberon  
I beg little changeling boy
To henchman 

TITANIA 
Set heart  rest 
    fairyl buys child 
His mother was vot ress order 
 spicèd Indian air  night 
Full often hath gossip side 
 sat Neptune yellow sands 
Marking th  embarkèd traders flood 
When  laugh see sails conceive 
 grow big bellied wanton wind 
Which  pretty swimming gait
Following (her womb  rich young squire) 
Would imitate  sail upon l 
To fetch trifles  return again 
As voyage  rich merchandise 
But  being mortal  boy did die 
 sake  rear up boy 
 sake  part  

OBERON 
How long within wood intend stay  

TITANIA 
Perchance till after Theseus  wedding day 
If patiently dance round 
 see moonlight revels  go us 
If  shun   spare haunts 

OBERON 
Give boy  go   

TITANIA 
Not thy fairy kingdom  Fairies  away 
We chide downright  longer stay 

 Exit Titania Train  

OBERON 
Well  go thy way  shalt grove
Till  torment   injury —
My gentle Puck   hither  rememb rest
Since once  sat upon promontory 
 heard mermaid dolphin back
Uttering such dulcet harmonious breath
That rude sea grew civil  song
 certain stars shot madly  spheres
To hear sea maid music 

PUCK 
I remember 

OBERON 
That very time  saw  (but couldst not) 
Flying between cold moon earth 
Cupid arm  certain aim took
At fair vestal  thronèd west 
 loos love shaft smartly bow
As should pierce hundred thous hearts 
But  might see young Cupid fiery shaft
Quench chaste beams watery moon 
 imperial votress passed 
In maiden meditation  fancy free 
Yet mark  where bolt Cupid fell 
It fell upon little western flower 
Before milk white  purple love wound 
 maidens call love idleness 
Fetch flower  herb  showed   once 
    juice sleeping eyelids laid
Will make man woman madly dote
Upon next live creature sees 
Fetch herb  again
Ere leviathan can swim league 

PUCK 
I ll put girdle round about earth
In forty minutes 

 Exit Puck  

OBERON 
Having once juice 
I ll watch Titania asleep 
 drop liquor eyes 
    next thing  waking looks upon
(Be lion  bear  wolf  bull 
On meddling monkey  busy ape)
She pursue soul love 
 ere  take charm off sight
(As  can take another herb)
I ll make render up page 
But who comes here    invisible 
  overhear  conference 

 Enter Demetrius  Helena following  

DEMETRIUS

Hence  get   gone  follow more 

HELENA 
You draw  hard hearted adamant 
But yet draw iron  heart
Is true steel  Leave power draw

Use spaniel  spurn  strike 
Neglect  lose  only give leave 
Unworthy  follow

Than usèd use dog  

DEMETRIUS 
Tempt too much hatred spirit 
For  sick  look   

HELENA

DEMETRIUS 
You impeach modesty too much
To leave city commit yourself
Into hands  loves 
To trust opportunity night

With rich worth virginity 

HELENA 
Your virtue privilege  
It night  see face 
Therefore  think  night 
Nor doth wood lack worlds company 
For  respect   world 
Then how can said  alone
When world look me  

DEMETRIUS

 leave   mercy wild beasts 

HELENA 
    wildest hath such heart 
Run  story chang 
Apollo flies  Daphne holds chase 
    dove pursues griffin  mild hind
Makes speed catch tiger  Bootless speed 
When cowardice pursues valour flies   

DEMETRIUS 
I stay thy questions  Let go 
Or follow  believe
But    mischief wood 

HELENA 
Ay  temple  town  field

Where oxlips nodding violet grows 
Quite over canopied luscious woodbine 
With sweet musk roses  eglantine 
There sleeps Titania sometime night 
Lull these flowers dances delight 
 snake throws enamell skin 
Weed wide enough wrap fairy 
 juice  ll streak eyes 
 make full hateful fantasies 
Take some  seek through grove 
A sweet Athenian lady love
With disdainful youth  Anoint eyes 
But next thing espies
May lady  shalt know man
By Athenian garments hath 
Effect some care  may prove
More fond than upon love 
 look meet ere first cock crow 

PUCK 
Fear  lord  servant

Two bosoms interchainèd an oath 
So  two bosoms single troth 
Then side bed room deny 
For lying Hermia   lie 

HERMIA 
Lysander riddles very prettily 
Now much beshrew manners pride 
If Hermia meant say Lysander lied   
But  gentle friend  love courtesy
Lie further off  human modesty 
Such separation may well said
Becomes virtuous bachelor maid 
So far distant  good night  sweet friend 
Thy love ne er alter till thy sweet life end   

LYSANDER

On whose eyes  might approve
This flower force stirring love 
Night silence    Who here  
Weeds Athens doth wear 
This  master said 
Despisèd Athenian maid

On dank dirty ground 
Pretty soul  durst lie
Near lack love  kill courtesy 
Churl  upon thy eyes  throw
All power charm doth owe 
When wak st  love forbid
Sleep seat thy eyelid 
So awake  gone

HELENA 
O   out breath fond chase   
    more prayer  lesser grace 
Happy Hermia  wheresoe er lies 
For hath blessèd attractive eyes 
How came eyes bright   Not salt tears 
If eyes  oftener wash than hers 
No    ugly bear 
For beasts meet run away fear 
Therefore marvel though Demetrius
Do  monster  fly presence thus 
What wicked dissembling glass mine
Made compare Hermia sphery eyne  
But who here   Lysander  ground   
Dead asleep    see blood  wound 
Lysander  live  good sir  awake

[_Waking run through fire  thy sweet sake 
Transparent Helena    Nature shows art 
That through thy bosom makes see thy heart

Do say Lysander  say 
What though love Hermia   Lord  though  
Yet Hermia still loves  Then content 

LYSANDER 
Content Hermia     repent
    tedious minutes   spent 
Not Hermia  Helena  love 
Who change raven dove  
    man reason sway 
 reason says  worthier maid 
Things growing  ripe until  season 
So  being young  till ripe reason 
 touching point human skill 
Reason becomes marshal 
 leads eyes  where  erlook
Love stories  written love richest book 

HELENA 
Wherefore was  keen mockery born  
When  hands did  deserve scorn  
Is t enough  t enough  young man 
That  did never   nor never can
Deserve sweet look Demetrius  eye 
But   flout insufficiency  
Good troth  wrong  good sooth  
In such disdainful manner woo 
But fare well  perforce    confess 
I thought lord more true gentleness 
O  lady  man refus 
Should another therefore abus d   

 Exit  

LYSANDER 
She sees Hermia  Hermia  sleep  
 never mayst  Lysander near   
For  surfeit sweetest things
    deepest loathing stomach brings 
Or heresies men leave
Are hated most those  did deceive 
So  surfeit heresy 
Of hated  most me

To honour Helen  knight

HERMIA 
[_Starting Help  Lysander  help me    thy best
To pluck crawling serpent breast   
Ay  pity    dream was here

Methought serpent eat heart away

Lysander     removed   Lysander    lord   
What  out hearing   Gone   sound  word  
Alack  where Speak  hear 
Speak  loves     swoon almost fear 
No   Then  well perceive  nigh

What night rule about haunted grove  

PUCK 
My mistress monster love 
Near close consecrated bower 
While was dull sleeping hour 
A crew patches  rude mechanicals 
That work bread upon Athenian stalls 
Were met together rehearse play
Intended great Theseus  nuptial day 
    shallowest thick skin barren sort
Who Pyramus presented  sport 
Forsook scene enter brake 
When  did   advantage take 
An ass nole  fixed head 
Anon  Thisbe   answerèd

As wild geese creeping fowler eye 
Or russet pated choughs  many sort 
Rising cawing  gun report 
Sever themselves madly sweep sky 
So  sight away fellows fly

He murder cries  help Athens calls 
Their sense thus weak  lost  fears  thus strong 
Made senseless things begin them wrong 
For briers thorns   apparel snatch 
Some sleeves  some hats  yielders things catch 
I led them distracted fear 
 left sweet Pyramus translated  
When moment  came pass 
Titania wak  straightway lov an ass 

OBERON

If hast slain Lysander sleep 
Being er shoes blood  plunge deep

From sleeping Hermia    ll believe soon
This whole earth may bor  moon
May through centre creep displease
Her brother noontide th  Antipodes 
It cannot hast murder  
So should murderer look  dead  grim 

DEMETRIUS 
So should murder look  should  
Pierc through heart stern cruelty 
Yet  murderer  look bright  clear 
As yonder Venus glimmering sphere 

HERMIA 
What Lysander   Where he  
Ah  good Demetrius  wilt give  me  

DEMETRIUS

HERMIA 
Out  dog    Out  cur    driv st past bounds
Of maiden patience  Hast slain   then  
Henceforth never number among men   
O once tell true  tell true  even sake   
Durst  look upon   being awake

Could worm  an adder  much  
An adder did  doubler tongue
Than thine  serpent  never adder stung 

DEMETRIUS 
You spend passion mispris mood

For debt bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe 
Which some slight measure pay

Of thy misprision   perforce ensue

LYSANDER 
Why should think  should woo scorn  
Scorn derision never  tears 
Look  vow   weep  vows born 
In  nativity truth appears 
How can these things seem scorn 
Bearing badge faith  prove them true  

HELENA 
You advance cunning more more 
When truth kills truth  devilish holy fray   
These vows  Hermia  give er  
Weigh oath oath  nothing weigh 
Your vows  put two scales 
Will even weigh  both light tales 

LYSANDER

DEMETRIUS 
[_Waking Helen  goddess  nymph  perfect  divine

Thy lips  those kissing cherries  tempting grow   
That pure congealèd white  high Taurus  snow 
Fann eastern wind  turns crow
When hold st up thy h    kiss
This princess pure white  seal bliss   

HELENA 
O spite    hell     see  bent
To set against merriment 
If were civil  knew courtesy 
You  thus much injury 
Can hate   know 
But   join souls mock too  
If were men  men  show 
You  use gentle lady 
To vow  swear  superpraise parts 
When  sure hate hearts 
You both  rivals  love Hermia 
 both rivals  mock Helena 
A trim exploit  manly enterprise 
To conjure tears up poor maid eyes
With derision    None noble sort
Would offend virgin  extort
A poor soul patience  make sport 

LYSANDER 
You  unkind  Demetrius  
For love Hermia  know  know

Wherein doth impair seeing sense 
It pays hearing double recompense 
Thou art mine eye  Lysander  found

But why unkindly didst leave so  

LYSANDER 
Why should stay whom love doth press go  

HERMIA 
What love could press Lysander side  

LYSANDER

Fair Helena  who more engilds night
Than yon fiery oes eyes light 
Why seek st me   Could make   know

Lo   confederacy

To fashion false sport spite

Have conspir   these contriv 
To bait foul derision  
Is counsel two  shar 
    sisters  vows  hours  spent 
When  chid hasty footed time
For parting us—O  forgot  
All school days  friendship  childhood innocence  
We  Hermia  like two artificial gods 
Have needles created both  flower 
Both  sampler  sitting  cushion 
Both warbling  song  both  key 
As hands  sides  voices  minds 
Had been incorporate  grew together 
Like double cherry  seeming parted 
But yet union partition 
Two lovely berries moulded  stem 
So  two seeming bodies   heart 
Two first  like coats heraldry 
Due   crownèd  crest 
 rent ancient love asunder 
To join men scorning poor friend  
It friendly   tis maidenly 
Our sex  well  may chide 
Though  alone feel injury 

HERMIA 
I amazèd  passionate words 
I scorn  seems scorn 

HELENA 
Have set Lysander  scorn 
To follow  praise eyes face  
 made other love  Demetrius 
Who even did spurn foot 
To call goddess  nymph  divine rare 
Precious  celestial   Wherefore speaks this
To hates   wherefore doth Lysander
Deny love  rich within soul 
 tender  forsooth  affection 
But setting  consent  
What though  grace 
So hung upon love  fortunate 
But miserable most  love unlov d  
This should pity rather than despise 

HERMIA 
I underst mean 

HELENA 
Ay   Persever  counterfeit sad looks 
Make mouths upon  turn back 
Wink each  other  hold sweet jest up 
This sport  well carried  chronicled 
If  any pity  grace  manners 
You  make such an argument 
But fare ye well   Tis partly own fault 
Which death  absence  soon remedy 

LYSANDER 
Stay  gentle Helena  hear excuse 
My love  life  soul  fair Helena   

HELENA 
O excellent

LYSANDER 
Thou canst compel more than entreat 
Thy threats  more strength than weak prayers 
Helen   love    life

To prove  false says  love   

DEMETRIUS 
I say  love   more than can

Hate me   Wherefore   me    news  love

Since night lov  yet since night left 
Why   left me—O  gods forbid   —
In earnest   say  

LYSANDER 
Ay  life

Therefore out hope  question  doubt 
Be certain  nothing truer   tis jest
That  hate   love Helena

You thief love    What      night

No touch bashfulness    tear
Impatient answers gentle tongue

Puppet    Why so   Ay  way goes game 
Now  perceive hath made compare
Between statures  hath urg height 
 personage  tall personage 
Her height  forsooth  hath prevail  
  grown high esteem
Because  dwarfish low  
How low  painted maypole   Speak 
How low I    yet low
But nails can reach unto thine eyes 

HELENA 
I pray  though mock  gentlemen 
Let hurt   was never curst 
I  gift  shrewishness 
I right maid cowardice 
Let strike  You perhaps may think 
Because something lower than myself 
That  can match 

HERMIA 
Lower    Hark  again 

HELENA 
Good Hermia  bitter 
I evermore did love  Hermia 
Did ever keep counsels  never wrong 
Save  love unto Demetrius 
I told  stealth unto wood 
He follow  love  follow  
But hath chid hence  threaten me
To strike  spurn  nay  kill too 
   quiet go 
To Athens  bear folly back

You see how simple how fond  

HERMIA 
Why  get gone  Who t hinders

Why suffer flout thus

LYSANDER 
Get gone  dwarf 
You minimus  hind ring knot grass made 
You bead  acorn 

DEMETRIUS

In behalf scorns services 
Let alone  Speak Helena 
Take part  dost intend
Never little show love 
Thou shalt aby 

LYSANDER 
Now holds

This thy negligence  still mistake st

By Athenian garments had on  
 far blameless proves enterprise
That    nointed an Athenian eyes 
 far  glad did sort 
As  jangling  esteem sport 

OBERON 
Thou seest these lovers seek place fight 
Hie therefore  Robin  overcast night 
    starry welkin cover anon
With drooping fog  black Acheron 
 lead these testy rivals astray
As   within another way 
Like Lysander sometime frame thy tongue 
Then stir Demetrius up bitter wrong 
 sometime rail like Demetrius 
 each other look lead them thus 
Till er  brows death counterfeiting sleep
With leaden legs batty wings doth creep 
Then crush herb into Lysander eye 
Whose liquor hath virtuous property 
To take thence error might
 make eyeballs roll wonted sight 
When  next wake  derision
Shall seem dream fruitless vision 
 back Athens lovers wend 
With league whose date till death never end 
Whiles  affair   employ 
I ll queen  beg Indian boy 
   charmèd eye release
From monster view  things peace 

PUCK 
My fairy lord    done haste 
For night swift dragons cut clouds full fast 
 yonder shines Aurora harbinger 
At whose approach  ghosts wandering 
Troop home churchyards  Damnèd spirits 
That cross ways floods  burial 
Already  wormy beds  gone 
For fear lest day should look  shames upon 
They wilfully themselves exile light 
   aye consort black brow night 

OBERON 
But  spirits another sort 
I morning love  oft made sport 
  like forester  groves may tread
Even till eastern gate  fiery red 
Opening Neptune fair blessèd beams 
Turns into yellow gold salt green streams 
But  notwithstanding  haste  make delay 
We may effect business yet ere day 

 Exit Oberon

Seeking sweet favours hateful fool

With coronet fresh fragrant flowers

Was wont swell like round orient pearls 
Stood within pretty flouriets  eyes 
Like tears did  own disgrace bewail 
When  had  pleasure taunted 
 mild terms begg patience 
I  did ask her changeling child 
Which straight gave  fairy sent
To bear  bower fairyl

This hateful imperfection eyes 
  gentle Puck  take transformèd scalp
From off head Athenian swain 
That awaking other 
May Athens back again repair

But fierce vexation dream 
But first  release Fairy Queen

THESEUS

So flew  sanded   heads  hung
With ears sweep away morning dew 
Crook knee dewlap like Thessalian bulls 
Slow pursuit  match mouth like bells 
Each under each cry more tuneable
Was never holla  nor cheer horn

HIPPOLYTA 
 Tis strange  Theseus  these lovers speak 

THESEUS 
More strange than true   never may believe
These antique fables  nor these fairy toys 
Lovers madmen  such seething brains 
Such shaping fantasies  apprehend
More than cool reason ever comprehends 
    lunatic  lover  poet
Are imagination compact 
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold 
That madman  lover  frantic 
Sees Helen beauty brow Egypt 
    poet eye  fine frenzy rolling 
Doth glance heaven earth  earth heaven 
imagination bodies forth
    forms things unknown  poet pen
Turns them shapes  gives airy nothing
A local habitation name 
Such tricks hath strong imagination 
That  apprehend some joy 
It comprehends some bringer joy 
Or night  imagining some fear 
How easy bush supposed bear

   Puts wretch lies woe

   Every  forth sprite
      In church way paths glide 
   fairies  run

      sweep dust behind door
